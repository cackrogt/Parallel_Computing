# Parallel_Computing
Some problems of parallel computing

Add names in order:

1. Perfect Numbers(A number is perfect if the sum of its proper factors is equal to the number) (lot of issues)
2. Value of pi (without using "reduce" directly) OMP
3. MPI Value of e^x given x 
4. Transfer in hypercube(mpi)(crude)
5. All to All personalized communication
6. Bubble sort balanced()
7. Matrix Multiplication 3 nested for loop parallel(again bad)
